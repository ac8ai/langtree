- **Type Safety**: Strong typing for commands, arguments, and variable values

---

## Variable System

LangTree DSL implements a sophisticated variable system with five distinct types as documented in the Language Specification Variable System section:

- **Assembly Variables** (`! var=value`) - Parse-time configuration values (assembly-time only)
- **Runtime Variables** (`{var}`) - Dynamic content interpolation during execution (runtime-only)
- **LangTree DSL Variable Targets** (`@each[var]`) - Collection iteration and variable tracking
- **Scope Context Variables** (`scope.field`) - Structured data access from specific execution contexts
- **Field References** (`[field]`) - Target fields for resampling and aggregation

**Critical Separation**: Assembly Variables and Runtime Variables are completely separate with no bridging between assembly and runtime contexts.

### @each RHS Runtime Variable Bridge

**Purpose**: @each commands create runtime variables at target nodes through their RHS (Right-Hand Side) variable mappings.

**Mechanism**: When @each processes collections, the RHS expressions in variable mappings become runtime variables available at the target node (TODO: adjust for different scopes of variables!):

```python
class SourceNode(TreeNode):
    """! @each[items]->target.processor@{{value.processed_items=items}}*"""
    items: list[str] = ["item1", "item2", "item3"]

class TargetProcessor(TreeNode):
    processed_items: list[str]  # This field gets populated by @each RHS
```

**Runtime Variable Creation Process**:
1. **@each Execution**: System iterates over `items` collection
2. **RHS Resolution**: For each iteration, `items` resolves to current iteration value
3. **Target Variable Creation**: `value.processed_items=items` creates runtime variable at target
4. **Field Population**: Target node's `processed_items` field receives the iterated values (TODO: It's not the same for prompt variables, for value or for output scope)
5. **Runtime Access**: Target prompts can use `{processed_items}` as runtime variable (TODO: only for prompt scope! Other scope usage needs to be mentioned as well)

**Key Principle**: The RHS of @each variable mappings becomes the "bridge" between iteration data and runtime variables at the target node. This enables iteration results to be consumed as normal runtime variables in target prompts.

**Example Flow**:
```python
# Source: @each[sections]->analyzer@{{value.content=sections.text}}*
# Creates: Runtime variable "content" at analyzer node
# Usage: Analyzer prompts can reference {content} for each section's text
# TODO **THIS IS VERY UNTRUE**, value scope is not a prompt scope!
```

**Architectural Significance**: This bridge is essential for @each command functionality - it transforms iteration data into runtime variables that target nodes can consume naturally through the `{var}` syntax.

### Template Variables

LangTree DSL provides special template variables for automatic prompt assembly:

- **`{PROMPT_SUBTREE}`**: Placeholder for child field content in parent docstrings
  - Automatically appended if not present in docstring
  - Replaced with assembled content from child fields with proper heading levels
  
- **`{COLLECTED_CONTEXT}`**: Placeholder for forwarded context data in prompts
  - Added when context is needed for prompt assembly
  - Replaced with context data from previous generations and forwarded outputs

See the Language Specification Template Variables section for detailed syntax and assembly rules.

## Architecture

### Tag-Based Data Forwarding

**Core Concept**: Variables map to long dotted keys that flow through LangChain's built-in mechanisms.

```python
# Source format
"sections.title" 

# Target format  
"analysis.sections.title"

# Complex nested example
"document.research.methodology.approach" -> "evaluation.document.research.methodology.approach"
```

**Validation**: LangChain supports arbitrarily long keys (tested up to 400+ characters).

### Context Assembly Order

**Hierarchical Assembly Algorithm** (designed for LLM cache efficiency):

1. **Root→Child→Current Pattern**: Context flows from document root through parent nodes to current field
   ```
   Root Node Context (document-level)
   ↓
   Parent Node Context (section-level)  
   ↓
   Current Node Context (field-level)
   ↓
   Generated Field Content
   ```

2. **Pre-calculated fields**: Forwarded/computed values positioned at hierarchy level
3. **Sequential dependencies**: Prior fields available to subsequent fields (@sequential - **recommended default**)
4. **Directed content placement**: Content "from below" positioned just before current field title
5. **Parallel isolation**: Fields generate independently (@parallel - for performance-critical cases)

**Technical Implementation**: The root→child→current pattern maintains stable template prefixes by layering context from general (document) to specific (field), enabling LLM provider cache efficiency.

### Node Execution Modifiers

#### @sequential (**Recommended Default**)
```python
class DocumentNode:
    """! @sequential"""
    title: str = "Pre-calculated"     # Position 1 in context
    introduction: str                 # Position 2, gets title  
    methodology: str                  # Position 3, gets title + introduction
    results: str                      # Position 4, gets all previous
```
- **Natural document flow**: Sections build on previous content
- **Rich context**: Each field gets all previously generated fields
- **Better coherence**: Enables sophisticated content generation patterns

#### @parallel (Performance Optimization)
```python
class SummaryNode:
    """! @parallel"""
    key_points: str      # Gets: pre_calculated only
    conclusions: str     # Gets: pre_calculated only
    recommendations: str # Gets: pre_calculated only
```
- **Independent generation**: Fields don't depend on each other
- **Faster execution**: True parallelism for performance-critical applications
- **Use for**: Summaries, extractions, factual data where context independence is desired

#### Container Field Modifiers
```python
class DocumentWithSections:
    """! @sequential"""
    sections: List[SectionNode] = Field(description="! @sequential")  # Element-by-element with context
    summaries: List[SummaryNode] = Field(description="! @parallel")   # Parallel generation, then accumulate
```

**Auto-forwarding**: In @sequential nodes, prior fields automatically forwarded to subsequent fields  
**Context Priority**: Any field with a known value (external forwarding, pre-calculated, or previously generated) appears in context **before** the currently processing field
**Override**: Explicit forwarding disables auto-resolution for that specific field

### Scope System

#### Core Scopes
- **`prompt`**: Target context prompt variables
- **`value`**: Output becomes target variable value
- **`outputs`**: Direct assignment scope (bypasses LLM during chain assembly)
- **`task`**: Reference to Task classes

#### Scope Resolution During Chain Assembly
```python
# outputs scope - direct assignment during chain assembly (bypasses LLM)
"outputs.title" -> direct_assignment_to_title
# → Data flows to dedicated "Outputs" section in target prompt (planned)

# prompt scope - include in prompt context (provides context TO LLM)  
"prompt.title" -> include_in_prompt_context
# → Data flows to "Context" section in target prompt

# value scope - LLM output becomes variable value (LLM generates content)
"value.title" -> LLM_generates_title_content
# → LLM execution populates target field

# task scope - reference other LangTree DSL nodes
"task.summarize" -> reference_to_summarization_node
# → Creates dependency links in execution graph
```

**Prompt Assembly**: When executing a chain, the target node's prompt includes:
- **Context section**: General contextual information (`prompt` scope data)
- **Outputs section** (planned): All forwarded results and subchain outputs (`outputs` scope data)
- **Task section**: Node docstring and instructions  
- **Input section**: Direct input data

**Key Distinction**: 
- `outputs` = Data flows directly without LLM processing → Goes to "Outputs" section of target prompt
- `value` = LLM generates content that becomes the variable → LLM execution result
- `prompt` = Data flows TO LLM as context → Goes to "Context" section of target prompt  
- `task` = References to other nodes in LangTree DSL tree → Builds execution dependencies

## Implementation Guide

### Core Components

The LangTree DSL framework consists of three main components that work together to transform prompt trees into executable chains:

#### 1. RunStructure
**Purpose**: Main orchestrator for building prompt trees and compiling to LangChain chains
- Coordinates tree building from TreeNode classes
- Manages variable registries and pending target resolution
- Provides the interface for chain assembly and execution planning

#### 2. TreeNode  
**Purpose**: Base class for hierarchical prompt structures with LangTree DSL annotations
- Enables declarative definition of prompt components
- Supports LangTree DSL command annotations in docstrings
- Provides structural foundation for tree building

#### 3. LangTree DSL Parser
**Purpose**: Transforms command strings into structured objects for chain assembly
- Extracts scope modifiers from all path components
- Handles complex variable mappings and multiplicity indicators
- Validates command syntax and semantic correctness

### Three-Phase Execution Architecture

LangTree DSL follows a three-phase execution model that separates validation, execution, and result assembly:

#### Phase 1: Assembly Time (Current Implementation ✅)
**Purpose**: Validate structure and prepare LangChain pipelines
- **Type Validation**: Check that source → target type mappings are valid (configurable)
- **Dependency Resolution**: Build execution dependency graph
- **Chain Building**: Create LangChain Runnable pipelines
- **Variable Tracking**: Register all assembly and runtime variables
- **Command Processing**: Parse and validate all LangTree DSL commands

```python
# Assembly phase - current implementation
structure = RunStructure()
structure.add(TaskNode)  # Type validation occurs here
execution_plan = structure.get_execution_plan()
```

**Type Validation**: Optional for performance (controlled by `enable_type_validation` flag)

#### Phase 2: Chain Execution (LangChain Implementation)
**Purpose**: Execute LangChain pipelines, collect raw outputs
- **String Conversion**: All data becomes strings for LLM processing
- **Context Assembly**: Build prompts with `{COLLECTED_CONTEXT}` resolution
- **Pipeline Execution**: Run prepared LangChain chains in dependency order
- **Raw Output Storage**: Store string outputs from each chain

```python
# Execution phase - delegated to LangChain
chains = structure.build_langchain_pipeline()  # Future implementation
results = chains.invoke(external_inputs)
```

**Note**: LangTree DSL framework builds the chains; LangChain handles execution

#### Phase 3: Result Collection (Planned Implementation ⏭️)
**Purpose**: Apply type conversions and assemble final structured outputs
- **Type Conversion**: Apply stored conversion rules to actual output data
- **Data Assembly**: Convert string outputs back to structured types
- **Final Aggregation**: Build complete structured artifacts
- **Context Collection**: Assemble `{COLLECTED_CONTEXT}` with proper type conversions

```python
# Result collection phase - future implementation
structured_results = structure.collect_results(raw_outputs)  # Applies type conversions
final_context = structure.assemble_collected_context(structured_results)
```

**Implementation Status**: Type conversion logic exists but is not yet called during result collection.

### Chain Assembly Architecture

#### Template Variable Resolution System
The framework uses template strings with execution-time resolution rather than immediate value substitution. This approach enables:

- **Server-side cache efficiency**: Template structures remain stable across iterations to maximize LLM provider cache hits
- **Lazy evaluation**: Values resolved only when chains execute
- **LangChain compatibility**: Uses native template variable mechanisms

#### Hierarchical System Prompts with Prefix Matching
Prompt inheritance follows longest prefix matching:
- Complex paths inherit from simpler parent paths
- Context-sensitive formatting based on base prompt structure
- Deterministic prompt assembly with clear inheritance rules

#### Server-Side Cache Friendly Design
The system is designed to maximize LLM provider cache efficiency (e.g., OpenAI cache) by maintaining stable template structures while varying only the data content. This reduces token costs through cache hits when executing similar nodes.

### Integration Patterns

#### Composite Chain Architecture
LangTree DSL-generated chains integrate seamlessly with existing LangChain infrastructure through composite patterns that combine:
- External preprocessing chains
- LangTree DSL tree-generated chains  
- Post-processing and validation chains

#### External Chain Integration
The framework supports integration with existing chain infrastructure through:
- Preprocessing result injection
- Context enhancement mechanisms
- Completion hooks for validation and post-processing

#### External Pipeline Integration

**Integration with existing extraction and preprocessing pipelines requires solution design.**

Current approach for external data:
- Manual integration via external inputs to RunStructure
- Direct variable assignment through scope resolution
- Custom preprocessing before LangTree DSL chain assembly

**Note**: Automated integration patterns for external extraction pipelines (e.g., title extraction, document preprocessing) need architectural design and implementation.**Current Chain Infrastructure Compatibility**:
- Existing `chains.py` infrastructure remains fully compatible
- `prepare_chain()` function can be used as building blocks for LangTree DSL-generated chains
- Standard prompt template, LLM binding, and output parsing patterns are preserved
- Sampling chains and structured output support integrate seamlessly

**Integration Status and Limitations**:

**✅ Currently Available**:
- Structure building and command parsing
- Variable tracking and basic validation
- Execution plan generation (heuristic)
- Compatible with existing LangChain infrastructure

**🔄 Partially Implemented**:
- Context resolution for chain assembly validation
- Basic DAG extraction from commands
- Template variable resolution framework

**❌ Missing for Complete Integration**:
- Tag-based forwarding implementation
- @sequential/@parallel node modifier support
- Automatic chain generation from LangTree DSL structures
- Multiplicity expansion (@each commands)
- Hierarchical prompt assembly from cleaned docstrings
- Full topological ordering for execution

### Advanced Implementation Patterns

#### Variable Closure Engine
The system validates that all variables can be resolved during chain assembly through comprehensive closure analysis that identifies:
- Successfully resolved variables
- Pending variables awaiting resolution
- Resolution errors and their causes

**Current Implementation** (essential for chain assembly validation):
- Variables tracked through complete lifecycle: declared → satisfied → validated
- Forward references handled via **PendingTargetRegistry** for nodes referenced before definition
- **VariableRegistry** tracks satisfaction sources and relationship types for closure analysis
- Comprehensive validation detects unresolved targets, unsatisfied variables, and circular dependencies
- Fan-in merging and conflict resolution handled through configurable policies (first, reduce, aggregate)

**Key Tracking Components**:
- **Variable Status**: Binary satisfied/unsatisfied with comprehensive closure validation
- **Forward References**: Pending targets tracked until resolution when referenced nodes are added
- **Dependency Graphs**: Variable flows and target references tracked for validation and execution planning  
- **Chain Assembly Validation**: Ensures all references can be resolved before chain building

**Why This Tracking is Essential for LangChain Integration**:

1. **Dependency Ordering**: Must know which nodes depend on which others to build correct LangChain pipeline order
2. **Input Validation**: Must identify all external inputs required before chain execution begins
3. **Reference Resolution**: Must validate all LangTree DSL references can be resolved to valid LangChain variables
4. **Error Prevention**: Must catch unresolved references before LangChain chain assembly to prevent runtime failures
5. **Execution Planning**: Must generate valid execution graphs that LangChain can process

The framework serves as a **validation and planning layer** that ensures the LangChain chains we build will execute successfully.
- **Assembly-Time Focus**: Validation occurs during chain building, not execution
- **No Runtime Persistence**: Framework doesn't store execution outputs or maintain runtime state during execution
- **LangChain Delegation**: Complex variable resolution delegated to LangChain's native mechanisms during execution
- **Simplified Status Model**: Focus on assembly validation rather than complex runtime state machines

#### DAG Execution Planning
Dependency graphs are extracted from LangTree DSL commands to enable:
- Topological ordering for execution
- Parallel execution identification
- Dependency validation and optimization

**Current Implementation** (simplified heuristic):
- Each node with commands becomes a potential chain step
- Variable flows tracked from satisfaction sources to target variables
- Unresolved targets flagged as blocking issues
- External inputs identified from truly unsatisfied variables

**Simplifications vs. Complex V2 Design**:
- **No Detailed JSON Format**: Simple dict structure rather than complex execution metadata
- **Heuristic Ordering**: Basic dependency tracking instead of full topological sort
- **Pending Full Implementation**: Multiplicity expansion and advanced dependency analysis still TODO
- **LangChain Integration Focus**: Designed for LangChain pipeline composition rather than custom execution engine

#### Multiplicity Expansion for @each Commands
The framework handles collection iteration through automatic expansion of @each commands into parallel execution patterns.

#### Template Assembly Algorithm
The system assembles hierarchical prompts through a deterministic process:

1. **Ancestor Collection**: Traverse from target node to root, collecting cleaned docstrings
2. **Path Integration**: Include field descriptions that lead toward the target node
3. **Variable Substitution**: Resolve template variables using scoped resolution order
4. **Segment Concatenation**: Join segments with consistent separators and formatting

#### Performance Considerations

**Token Efficiency**: The framework optimizes for minimal token usage through:
- Stable template structures that maximize LLM provider cache hits
- Deterministic prompt assembly that avoids redundant content
- Strategic variable placement to leverage server-side caching

**Chain Complexity Management**: Implementation approach for complex assemblies:
- **Context Assembly Algorithm**: Root→child→current hierarchical pattern (see Context Assembly Order section)
- **Execution Sequencing**: Sequential field generation with prior context availability
- **Container Field Processing**: Element-by-element generation for List[Node] fields
- **Validation Pipeline**: Assembly-time error detection before chain building
- **Dependency Resolution**: Topological ordering of node execution
- **Multiplicity Expansion**: Parallel pattern generation for @each commands

#### Error Classification

The framework categorizes errors into distinct types for effective debugging:

- **Syntax Errors**: LangTree DSL command parsing failures
- **Semantic Errors**: Invalid variable references or scope violations  
- **Assembly Errors**: Chain building failures during compilation
- **Validation Errors**: Circular dependencies or unresolved references

## Testing Framework

The LangTree DSL framework includes comprehensive testing infrastructure to ensure reliability and maintainability.

### Core Test Philosophy
Testing follows a multi-layered approach that validates both individual components and their integration:

- **Unit Tests**: Validate LangTree DSL parsing, variable resolution, and template assembly
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure LangTree DSL trees compile correctly to LangChain chains
- **Chain Tests**: Validate external chain integration and composite pipeline behavior
- **Performance Tests**: Ensure template caching and execution efficiency

### Testing Patterns

#### Component Testing
Individual LangTree DSL components are tested with realistic prompt tree structures to validate:
- Command parsing accuracy and error handling
- Variable resolution completeness and closure validation
- Template assembly correctness and cache efficiency

#### Integration Testing
Chain compilation and integration testing ensures:
- LangTree DSL trees compile to valid LangChain chains
- External preprocessing chains integrate correctly
- Composite pipelines maintain data flow integrity
- Variable mappings resolve correctly across chain boundaries

#### Mock Strategies
Testing uses comprehensive mocking for:
- LLM providers to avoid API dependencies during testing
- External chain responses for predictable integration testing
- Complex data structures for performance and stress testing

#### Performance Validation
Performance testing validates:
- Template caching provides expected speedup for repeated executions
- Chain assembly scales appropriately with tree complexity
- Memory usage remains bounded during large tree processing

### Open Design Decisions

| Topic | Options | Preferred |
|-------|---------|-----------|
| Fan-in merging | First, reduce(list), policy map | Policy map (configurable) |
| Wildcard handling | External injection, whole object snapshot | Whole object snapshot + provenance tag |
| Prompt caching | Always rebuild, cache by hash | Hash segments for deterministic caching |
| Error propagation | Fail-fast, accumulate | Accumulate with severity tiers |

### Known Issues & Current Challenges

#### Critical Bugs (18 Failing Tests)
- **Template Variable Spacing Validation**: Rejecting valid spacing patterns - needs algorithm fix
- **Variable Target Validation**: `VariableTargetValidationError` in multiple scope resolution scenarios
- **Command Parser Robustness**: `CommandParseError: Strict whitespace violation` in edge cases
- **LangChain Integration Layer**: Type errors and validation failures preventing chain building

#### Missing Core Features (106 Skipped Tests)
- **Runtime Variable System**: No `{var}` syntax support - highest priority missing feature
- **Advanced Template Variables**: Complex spacing scenarios and multiple variable handling
- **Enhanced Scope Resolution**: Deep nesting and cross-node resolution capabilities
- **Performance & Scale**: Large tree handling and bulk operation support

#### Test Suite Honesty Issues (Recently Fixed)
- **Fake-Passing Tests**: Converted 80+ `assert True` tests to properly skipped tests
- **Print-Based Testing**: Removed ineffective print-only tests 
- **Honest Coverage**: Now showing 52% actual working functionality vs inflated coverage

#### Architecture Gaps
- **LangChain Integration**: Chain building infrastructure incomplete
- **Runtime Execution**: No actual chain orchestration implemented
- **Advanced Validation**: Specification compliance features missing

### Optimization Strategies

For very complex chain assemblies, consider these optimization approaches:

#### 1. **Hierarchical Context Assembly**
- Implement root→child→current pattern (defined in Context Assembly Order section)
- Provides stable prefix structure for LLM provider cache hits
- Reduces token costs through better caching efficiency

#### 2. **Execution Mode Implementation**
- **@sequential implementation**: Framework provides prior field context to subsequent field generation
- **@parallel implementation**: Framework isolates field generation with independent contexts  
- **Container field processing**: List[Node] fields support per-element vs batch generation modes
- **Default behavior**: @sequential set as framework default for document generation workflows

#### 3. **Cache-Friendly Design**
- Template structures remain stable across executions
- Variable content changes while template keys stay consistent  
- Strategic placement of generated content for optimal cache utilization

#### 4. **External Integration Patterns**
- Manual external input integration through RunStructure
- Direct scope assignment for external data  
- **Note**: Automated integration patterns need architectural design

## Architectural Decisions Log

### 1. Remove Runtime State Management ✅
**Decision**: Focus purely on chain assembly, let LangChain handle execution
**Rationale**: Simplifies architecture, leverages proven LangChain patterns
**Impact**: No runtime state tracking, no execution result storage

### 2. Tag-Based Data Forwarding ✅  
**Decision**: Use arbitrarily long dotted keys for variable forwarding
**Rationale**: LangChain supports this natively, avoids custom runtime
**Impact**: Clean data flow, deterministic behavior, extensible

### 3. Node Execution Modifiers ✅
**Decision**: Add @sequential/@parallel to control field generation order
**Rationale**: Explicit control over dependencies vs parallelism
**Impact**: Deterministic context assembly, clear semantics

### 4. Deterministic Context Assembly ✅
**Decision**: Pre-calculated fields first, then definition order
**Rationale**: Predictable prompt generation, reproducible results
**Impact**: Clear ordering rules, easier debugging

### 5. Documentation Consolidation 🔄
**Decision**: Merge multiple docs into comprehensive guide
**Rationale**: Reduce complexity, improve navigation, single source of truth
**Impact**: Easier maintenance, clearer for new developers

---

## Migration Notes

### From Current Implementation

1. **Update resolution.py**: Replace path-based with tag-based forwarding
2. **Add node modifiers**: Parse @sequential/@parallel from docstrings  
3. **Implement context assembly**: Deterministic ordering algorithm
4. **Build chain generation**: Convert tags to LangChain pipelines
5. **Update tests**: Reflect new tag-based architecture
